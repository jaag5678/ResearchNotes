    \begin{frame}{Compositional Verification: Idea}

        %Difficult to determine all possible contexts.
        %Create an abstraction to consider only relevant contexts (denotation)
        %Reason about transformations using this abstract context.
        %Prove Soundness and Completeness.

    \begin{frame}{Denotation of Code Blocks: Block Executions} 

        %Denotation is mainly pertaining to the context the block can have

        %Relevant details for each block execution
            %Local variables
            %Global variables -- only concerning ourselves with those global variables that the code block accesses.
            %Context happens-before --- Any happens-before relations that the context has between its events. 
            %Context-atomicity ---> SB edges.

    \end{frame}

    \note{
        We have a code block within which we do some transformation.
        Now, what external stuff can affect its validity? 
        The authors defined this as a context, and we record every relevant infromation (which we call denotation) of a context that can affect the transformation we do on the code block. 
        Note that, the relations we count wrt context does not involve those between context and code block events (like \rf, \hb).
        We need to keep a note of this, as we do not yet have an intuition as to why they aren't considered.
